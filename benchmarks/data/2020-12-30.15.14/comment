Rebooted, running again. This time the EFI partition is still at /dev/nvme2n1p1. One difference is that the last time I tried this I failed to press F11 to catch the reboot after the failure--so it booted into windows and I had reboot from the windows login screen--there was no indication that updates were installed--could the mere act of booting into windows be altering something?
